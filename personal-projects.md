The California Forest Fires were quite unsettling for my family and I. Since we lived near one of the evacuation zones, we were constantly checking news and social media for any status updates on the fires. However, I started to notice that a lot of contradicting information was being spread about the evacuation orders through news outlets and social media. This led to many of neighbors unnecessarily evacuating. My friend and I rapidly developed a chatbot that scraped information from every county in California to give the most relevant information about their county's evacuation orders. The bot was used over 2,000 times in a two week span. The bot is currently deactivated as the forest fires have since subsided.

After getting extremely sick because of a bad case of food poisoning, I started to wonder why it was so difficult to find out whether the food you are eating could make you sick. This led to my friend and I developing Frecure (Fresh and Secure) - an app that notifies users anytime it detects a food recall in their city. The app works by scraping various government food databases and using natural language processing techniques to extract recall information. Using services such as twilio, mailgun, and mjml, I was able to notify about recalls users via email or text. At its peak the service had around 200 users. We decided to take the service down for now as we are trying to determine ways to better market the service.
